# Exercise 1

Refer to Example problem **FruitSaleSim1.cpp** (Fruit seller simulation) given at **Chapter 03**. In there, member variables in two classes are declared as *private*. But, they have nothing to meet the following requirement.

**"CANNOT use a number which is smaller than 0 as a parameter for purchasing apples."**

Give changes for **FruitSaleSim1.cpp** to meet the above requirement, and declare some functions "const" to improve its stability.
